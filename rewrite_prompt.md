Please rewrite the following report on a security vulnerability in a Web3 protocol with the following goals:

1. *Clarity:* Enhance the description and details of the report to ensure that the information is easily understandable by a broad audience, including those who may not have a deep technical background.

2. *Structure Consistency:* Maintain the original structure of the report, including section headings, subheadings, and the overall flow of information. The content should be reorganized or rephrased only if it aids in clarity but must retain the original sequence.

3. *Code Integrity:* Do *not* alter any code snippets, technical data, or specific terminologies that are crucial for accurately conveying the technical aspects of the vulnerability. The code should be left exactly as it is.

4. *Simplified Language:* Use simpler words and phrases where possible without losing the technical accuracy of the report. Avoid jargon or overly complex language that could confuse readers.

5. *Detailed Explanations:* Where necessary, expand on explanations to provide more context or background information that could help readers better understand the significance of the vulnerability and its potential impact.

IMPORTANT: Don't change the existing structure of the report, including headings, subheadings, and code snippets. Only rewrite the content within each section to meet the specified goals. Don't make additional structure inside the content like "1. the problem:" and "2. Impact".
